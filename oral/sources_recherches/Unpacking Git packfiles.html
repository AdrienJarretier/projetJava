  <article class="post-content">
    <p>While working on <a href="https://github.com/ChimeraCoder/gitgo/">Gitgo</a>,
 an implementation of Git in pure Go, I encountered a puzzling issue. 
Gitgo tests its own dogfood, which means the tests for parsing objects 
use the git repository for Gitgo itself. This worked fine for a few 
days, until my pairing partner wanted to work on his computer instead of
 mine. I pushed the code to a remote repository so he could check it 
out, and we immediately noticed that all of the tests suddenly started 
failing on <em>both</em> of our computers, complaining that the commit objects did not exist. Sure enough, the commits were missing from <code>.git/objects/</code>. And yet, we were both still able to check out the supposedly missing commits on our machines using Git. What was going wrong?</p>

<p>The commit objects were there, but they were stored in a different location, as <em>packfiles</em>.</p>

<h2 id="packfile-motivation">Packfile motivation</h2>

<p>Git was built to be fast. One of the reasons that <code>git checkout</code>
 is fast is that it doesn’t actually store any diffs. Instead, Git 
stores the actual, raw, content of every file at each commit, which it 
uses to calculate diffs on-the-fly. All this data starts to quickly add 
up in size, so Git does three things to reduce the space on disk.</p>

<p>First, it compresses files before storing them, using zlib. Zlib 
reduces the footprint of each file while still being quick to decompress
 (“inflate”). If you didn’t have version control software, but wanted to
 be able to reference previous versions of your work, you might simply 
create a ZIP archive of your directory every day as a makeshift “version
 control.” Although Git uses a different compression algorithm, this is 
almost exactly what it does!</p>

<p>The second way that Git saves disk space is by doing deduplication, a
 technique to remove redundant data. When creating a new commit, Git 
SHA-1 hashes the contents of each tracked file within the commit to 
compare to the hashes of all the objects it already has. If a file’s 
hash matches an existing object’s hash, Git doesn’t store any new 
content for that file.</p>

<p>This is why <code>git mv</code> acts like a regular <code>mv</code> followed by a <code>git add</code> of the new file and a <code>git rm</code>
 of the old one. Git doesn’t actually need to know that you’ve moved a 
file; it just needs to know that there’s now a file with a different 
name whose content happens to be the same as a previously tracked file.</p>

<p>There’s a problem with all of this, though. Hashing functions are 
designed to avalanche: changing just a single bit in an input to a 
hashing function should yield a completely different output.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code>$ echo "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dogs" | sha1sum 
ce1ac435d9d47079f74874ed49615225d1be7be4  -
$ echo "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dogs." | sha1sum 
87344ca7264d0f3e1d4e1350aeb71ffb597af8e2  -
$ echo "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dogz" | sha1sum 
a262234693b48b9c93ac3d69ce5818ade116a4be  -
</code></pre></div>
<p>Even if two files mostly match, if there’s any difference at all Git 
thinks they’re completely different. This isn’t a problem if you never 
plan on modifying the code you write – but at that point, why bother 
using version control in the first place?</p>

<p>It turns out that this isn’t that problematic for many projects. Zlib
 compression is quite powerful, and disk space is cheap enough that Git 
is happy to use nothing more than these two techniques for quite a 
while. But there’s one thing that isn’t quite so cheap: bandwidth. Even 
if your ISP doesn’t charge you per-megabyte, you still care about how 
long it takes you to clone, push, and pull. Git is meant to be fast, and
 taking lots of data that is similar-but-not-quite-identical, 
compressing it, and then transmitting it over the wire is slow.</p>

<h2 id="enter-packfiles">Enter packfiles</h2>

<p>I’ll count packfiles as the third strategy that Git uses to reduce 
disk space usage, even though packfiles were really created to reduce 
network usage (and increase network performance). It’s helpful to keep 
this in mind because the design of Git’s packfiles were informed by the 
goal of making network usage easy. Reducing the disk space needed is a 
pleasant side effect.</p>

<p>You can check for any packfiles in a Git repository by looking under <code>.git/objects/pack/</code>.
 If you’re looking at a repository you created yourself, this directory 
may be empty because packfiles are usually created the first time you 
push, pull, fetch, or clone. For a small or medium-sized repository, 
you’ll likely only see a single packfile, along with a corresponding 
index file:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code>$ ls .git/objects/pack/
pack-b3de836568441629d260ae19c7c1c11fa8ce5a5e.idx  pack-b3de836568441629d260ae19c7c1c11fa8ce5a5e.pack
</code></pre></div>
<p>Notice that the names of these files match except for the extension. 
The .pack file contains the actual Git objects and the .idx file 
contains the index used to quickly locate objects within the .pack file.</p>

<p>We can see which objects are contained in a pack with the Git command-line tools:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code>$ git verify-pack -v .git/objects/pack/pack-b3de836568441629d260ae19c7c1c11fa8ce5a5e.pack

</code></pre></div><p>(some entries ommitted for brevity)</p>

<p>Objects in a packfile can either be <em>deltified</em> or <em>non-deltified</em>.
 Deltification means that Git stores only a special diff instead of 
storing the whole object. Normal diffs reference a base object and 
describe a series of actions (e.g., insert, delete, or typechange) that 
should be applied to the base object in order to create the new result. 
Deltas work similarly, except that they’re not meant to be 
human-readable (and the actions that they describe are different).</p>

<p>Deltified objects are easy to spot in the <code>git verify-pack</code> output – they’re the ones with the extra SHA at the end. Instead of storing the entire object, they store a <em>delta</em> object.  The SHA at the end tells us the base object. In this case, <code>df084d8bce5c57acdebf0958bfdfa30b1e3f929c</code>  and <code>5aecdc1eb6a499010defdd06889f3ffc559b7206</code> both are stored as deltas with <code>200e279624a42905bed21c89139db6dd22f93610</code> as a base object.</p>

<p>The base object may also be deltified, which allows multiple layers 
of deltification, reducing the total size even further. For deltified 
objects, the second-to-last field (right before the base object name) 
indicates the depth of the object. So <code>eeac5890e8e6b7500c12ebd51af4f6c6be6f9ccc</code> has two layers of deltification, because its base object is <code>9e08d4ffcc8beb10dc6eaaa93cdbdb00cfc95be9</code>, which is also a delta, and this second delta’s base object is <code>be5d471b02b9ee56538c8dc04253ec7206a43971</code>. Don’t get thrown off by the hexadecimal names – at its root (no pun intended), this is just a recursive data structure.</p>

<h2 id="parsing-packfiles">Parsing packfiles</h2>

<p>Packfiles are mostly self-contained. In fact, it’s possible to parse a
 packfile without an index file — the index file is merely for 
convenience and performance.</p>

<p>The packfile starts with 12 bytes of meta-information and ends with a
 20-byte checksum, all of which we can use to verify our results. The 
first four bytes spell “PACK” and the next four bytes contain the 
version number – in our case, [0, 0, 0, 2]. The next four bytes tell us 
the number of objects contained in the pack. Therefore, a single 
packfile cannot contain more than 2<sup>32</sup> objects, although a 
single repository may contain multiple packfiles. The final 20 bytes of 
the file are a SHA-1 checksum of all the previous data in the file.</p>

<p>The heart of the packfile is a series of data chunks, with some 
metainformation preceding each one. This is where things get 
interesting! The metainformation is formatted slightly differently 
depending on whether the data chunk that comes after it is deltified or 
not. In both cases, they begin by telling us the size of the object that
 the packfile contains. This size is encoded as a variable-length 
integer with a special format.</p>

<p>Because the integer has a variable length, the first bit of each byte
 – also called the MSB, for “most significant bit” - is reserved. That 
bit tells us whether the next byte belongs as part of the 
variable-length integer that we’re decoding. If it’s a 1, we should read
 the next byte. An easy way to check for this is to check if the byte is
 less than 128, which is <code>10000000</code> in binary.</p>

<p>The very first byte of this integer contains one extra piece of 
information: the type of the object that follows. There are six defined 
types, which means that this information fits into three bits, and the 
three bits after the MSB are used to designate this information:</p>

<p><img src="Unpacking%20Git%20packfiles_files/varint.svg" alt="Packfile object header"></p>

<p>For the non-deltified types, the data that follows the 
metainformation is the zlib-compressed object data, which we can handle 
just like we handle normal Git objects. The variable-length integer 
tells us the expected size of the object after the object is inflated 
(decompressed).</p>

<p>How can we decompress the object if we don’t know how much data to read? It turns out that zlib is pretty robust and <a href="https://play.golang.org/p/z4xue6V0tv">will ignore any extra bytes added to the end of a valid zlib-compressed data stream</a>.
 Zlib is able to do this because the compressed data itself begins with 
its own header, but since we’re not implementing zlib’s inflate function
 from scratch, we can treat this binary data as a black box.</p>

<p>However, there’s a problem here. We can decompress the first object 
as long as we give zlib more data than it needs. But how do we know 
where the second object begins?</p>

<p>It turns out that, with the approach we’ve been using so far, we 
can’t! Go’s zlib library buffers the input that we feed it greedily. As a
 result, we can’t simply measure the number of bytes that the zlib 
library inputs – it may request to read more bytes than it ends up 
using. (This isn’t a problem exclusive to Go, either; <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28640738/how-can-i-deflate-zlib-data-and-find-out-how-many-input-bytes-there-were">other languages have similar issues</a>.)</p>

<p>This is where the IDX file comes in – it tells us where each object begins.</p>

<h2 id="idx-files">IDX files</h2>

<p>While it’s possible to to work around the aforementioned buffering 
issues and parse a packfile without ever reading the IDX file, the index
 makes it a lot easier. Like the packfile, a version 2 index file starts
 with a header, though the index file header is only eight bytes instead
 of 12. The first four bytes are always <code>255, 116, 79, 99</code>, 
which are chosen because the first version of the index file did not 
have any header information, and these four bytes would be an invalid 
start to a version 1 index file. The next four bytes denote the version 
number explicitly – in our case, version 2.</p>

<p><img src="Unpacking%20Git%20packfiles_files/idx-layer0.svg" alt="IDX Layer 0"></p>

<p>After the header, we encounter what Git calls a fanout table.</p>

<p>The first level of entries in this table is a series of 256 entries 
of four bytes each, 1024 bytes long in total. According to the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/v1.4.3/technical/pack-format.txt">documentation</a>,
 “[the] N-th entry of this table records the number of objects in the 
corresponding pack, the first byte of whose object name is less than or 
equal to N.”</p>

<p><img src="Unpacking%20Git%20packfiles_files/idx-layer1.svg" alt="IDX Layer 1"></p>

<p>Let’s break that down by example. Remember that object names are just
 SHAs, which we usually read in base-16. If the first entry of our 
fanout table is <code>4</code>, then we will eventually expect to find four objects whose 20-byte object name begins with <code>00</code>. If the second entry of the fanout table is also <code>4</code>, that means that we will expect to find zero objects whose 20-byte object name beings with <code>01</code>, because these totals are cumulative and we’ll already have four objects whose name begins with <code>00</code>. If the 17th entry is the first whose value is greater than <code>4</code>, and it has a value of <code>12</code>, then that means we will find exactly eight objects whose name begins with <code>10</code> (remember that object names use base 16).</p>

<p>This table has 256 entries, so the last entry tells us how many objects will have an object name that begins with <code>ff</code> or any one-byte hexadecimal value that is less than <code>0xFF</code>. Since <code>0xFF</code> (256) is the largest value that can fit into a single byte, the last entry tells us how many objects to expect in total.</p>

<p>The second layer of the fanout table contains the 20-byte object 
names, in order. We already know how many to expect from the first layer
 of the fanout table.</p>

<p>The third layer of the fanout table gives us a four-byte <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check">cyclic redundancy check</a>
  value for each object. Remember that packfiles are optimized for use 
across a network, so it’s important to be able to check that data did 
not get corrupted during transfer.</p>

<p>The fourth layer contains the information we’ve been looking for: the
 packfile offsets for each object. These are also four bytes per entry. 
If the packfile is less than 2 GB, the MSB of all of these values will 
be <code>0</code>, and the remaining bits contain the packfile offset. 
Otherwise, the offset may be too large to fit into 4 bytes. In this 
case, the offset will actually be stored in the fifth layer, the MSB in 
the fourth layer for that object will be <code>1</code>, and the remaining bits will be the offset in the fifth layer at which the offset into the packfile can be found.</p>

<p>The fifth and final layer is only present for packfiles larger than 
2GB. If present, it will contain a series of 8-byte entries that encode 
the offset in the packfile. As mentioned before, the fourth layer will 
indicate which entries in the fifth layer correspond to each object - if
 an element in the fourth layer has its MSB set, the remaining bits in 
that element specify which element in the fifth layer contain the 
packfile offset for that object.</p>

<p>This is the end of the fanout table. The index file itself ends with a
  20-byte checksum of the packfile and a 20-byte checksum of the entire 
index file.</p>

<h3 id="searching-packfiles">Searching packfiles</h3>
<p>At this point, you may be wondering why Git uses such a convoluted 
format. While this format may be difficult to read, it makes it possible
 to use binary search to locate a particlar object in an IDX file. If 
there are multiple packfiles, the only way to find a particular object 
is to search each one, so binary search is crucial for speed. 
Furthermore, remember that packfiles (and IDX files) were motivated by 
network performance. For dense packfiles, there’s very little redundant 
information in either the packfile or the index file. Information is 
packed not only into every byte, but into every bit.</p>

<h2 id="packfiles-revisited">Packfiles, revisited</h2>

<p>Now that we know where every object in the packfile starts, we can 
decode the rest of the packfile. For non-deltified objects, the actual 
data is just the zlib-compressed object data.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of deltified objects. If the type is <code>OBJ_REF_DELTA</code>
 (reference delta object), the object metainformation (which we already 
parsed earlier) is followed by the 20-byte name of the base object. 
Remember that deltas are analogous to diffs, so we need to know what the
 reference point is for the diff that we are about to apply. After this 
name, you’ll find the zlib-compressed delta data, which we’ll handle 
shortly.</p>

<p>However, even this was wasteful, so Git added the <code>OBJ_OFS_DELTA</code>
 (offset delta object). For these, instead of the 20-byte base object 
name, there’s another variable-length integer. Again, the MSB tells us 
where the last byte of the integer is. This integer represents a 
negative offset – it tells us how many bytes to scan backwards in the 
current packfile in order to find the base object. The negative offset 
is followed by the zlib-compressed delta data, just as for the <code>OBJ_REF_DELTA</code>.</p>

<h2 id="applying-deltas">Applying deltas</h2>

<p>We’re almost done! We’ve read the entire index file and packfile and 
we have a bunch of base objects and delta objects. The only thing we 
still need to do is apply the deltas to the base objects to reconstruct 
the missing objects.</p>

<p>The delta begins with the source and target lengths, both encoded as 
variable-length integers, which is useful for error checking, but is not
 essential. After this, there are a series of instructions, which may be
 either “copy” (MSB = 1) or “insert” (MSB = 0).</p>

<p>Copy instructions signal that we should copy a consecutive chunk of 
bytes from the base object to the output. There are two numbers that are
 necessary to perform this operation: the location (offset) of the first
 byte to copy, and the number of bytes to copy. These are stored as <em>little-endian</em> variable-length integers after each copy instruction; however, their contents are compressed.</p>

<p>Even though the byte offset is a 32-bit integer, Git only includes 
the non-zero bytes to save space, and the last four bits of the copy 
instruction signal how many bytes to read. This means that Git could 
store the number 536,870,912 in only a single byte!</p>

<p>For example, let’s say that the last four bytes of the copy instruction are <code>1010</code> and the next two bytes are <code>11010111 01001011</code>. This means that the byte offset is <code>01001011 00000000 11010111 00000000</code>, which is 1,258,346,240.</p>

<p>The copy length is interpreted the same way, with the middle three 
bits of the instruction signifying whether to advance the cursor or not,
 just as the last four bits signify whether to advance the cursor when 
constructing the byte offset.</p>

<p>Insert instructions are even easier. The insert instruction itself is
 the number of bytes to copy from the delta object to the output. Since 
insert instructions all have their MSB set to 0, the maximum number of 
bytes to insert is 127. So, if the instruction is <code>01001011</code>, that means that we should read the next 75 bytes of the delta object and copy them to the output.</p>

<p>And there we have it – we’ve parsed a packfile!</p>

<p>Packfiles are one of the few parts of Git that cannot be read or 
written at the command-line except when using Git’s plumbing tools. Most
 people who use Git don’t even know they exist, let alone what they are 
for or how to read them. Once you become comfortable with packfiles, 
you’re ready for pretty much everything Git can throw your way!</p>
